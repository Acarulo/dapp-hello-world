# Hello World! Dapp

This project deploys a simple interaction with a smart contract deployed in Goerli testnet.
The contract stores a string and holds two public methods: set(string calldata) and get().
The Dapp ensures a succesful connection to Goerli testnet using Metamask and allows the user to interact with the contract.
